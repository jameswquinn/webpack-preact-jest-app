# Detailed Process Description

1. Development
   - Entry Point (src/index.js): Main application entry
   - App Component (src/components/App/App.js): Main component structure
   - ResponsiveImage Component (src/components/ResponsiveImage/ResponsiveImage.js): Core responsive image handling

2. Configuration
   - Webpack Configuration:
     a. webpack.common.js: Common configuration for development and production
     b. webpack.dev.js: Development-specific configuration
     c. webpack.prod.js: Production-specific configuration

3. Local Testing
   - Run development server: `npm start`
   - Manual testing in browser
   - Unit tests: `npm test`

4. Version Control (Push to GitHub)
   - Commit changes: `git commit -m "Description of changes"`
   - Push to remote repository: `git push origin main`

5. CI/CD Pipeline
   - Automated testing on push to GitHub
   - Linting: `npm run lint`
   - Build verification

6. Build Process
   - Production build: `npm run build`
   - Optimization and minification of assets

7. Image Processing Flow
   - Generate WebP, PNG (with alpha), and JPEG versions of images
   - Create metadata JSON files for each image

8. Deployment
   - Deploy to Vercel: `npm run deploy` or automatic deployment via CI/CD

9. Production Release
   - Application goes live on Vercel

10. Runtime Behavior
    - ResponsiveImage component fetches metadata and renders appropriate image
    - Browser selects most suitable image based on format support and size

11. Error Handling (Ongoing)
    - ResponsiveImage component handles image loading errors
    - ErrorBoundary in App component catches rendering errors
    - Server-side error logging and monitoring

12. Monitor & Feedback
    - Track performance metrics (e.g., Core Web Vitals)
    - Gather user feedback
    - Analyze logs and error reports

This cycle repeats with new development based on monitoring insights and user feedback.
